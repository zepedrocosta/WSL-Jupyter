# Jupyter in WSL

This script will install python (if it is not already installed), jupyter and some [packages](requirements.txt) that are usually used in simulations that use jupyter.

## Use the script

The [jupyterWSL.sh](jupyterWSL.sh) script is meant to be used in WSL the following way:

1. Make the executable using the following comand. This way there is no need to type bash in the console.

```bash
chmod +x jupyterWSL.sh
```

2. Run the script.

```bash
./jupyterWSL.sh
```
